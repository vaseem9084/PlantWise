# PlantWise
🌱# Just launched my latest project: PlantWise - an AI-powered Plant Identification and Care App! 🌿 I’m excited to share PlantWise, a web application I developed using cutting-edge technologies to help plant enthusiasts, gardeners, and hobbyists easily identify plants and receive personalized care tips. Users can upload or snap a photo of a plant, and the app provides detailed information such as: 🌸 Plant Identification: Common and scientific names, plant family, and key characteristics. 💧 Growing Conditions: Light, water, and soil requirements. 🛠️ Care Tips: Regular maintenance advice, common issues, and seasonal care. 🦋 Pest & Disease Control: Environmentally friendly pest and disease management methods. 🔧 Tech Stack: Frontend: Built with Next.js and styled using Tailwind CSS for a responsive and visually engaging interface. AI Integration: Powered by Google’s Gemini to process and analyze images for plant identification. Image Upload: Enabled via React Dropzone for smooth image handling.
